\title{Assumption checks for one-sample t-test}
\usage{
check_assumptions(x, alpha = 0.05, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of observations.}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for the Shapiro–Wilk normality test.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, prints a short textual summary of
the results to the console.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{"oneMeanTest_assumptions"} with components:
\item{shapiro}{List with W statistic, p-value, \code{alpha}, and a logical
flag \code{normal} indicating if normality is acceptable (or \code{NA}
if the test was not run).}
\item{outliers}{Numeric vector of detected outliers (possibly empty).}
\item{n}{Sample size after removing NA values.}
\item{normal}{Logical flag indicating if normality is acceptable
(\code{TRUE} / \code{FALSE}), or \code{FALSE} if the Shapiro–Wilk test
rejects at the chosen \code{alpha}.}
\item{message}{Textual summary of the diagnostics.}
}
\description{
Check normality and outliers for a numeric sample, as typically required
for a one-sample t-test on a population mean with unknown variance.
}
\details{
The function performs a Shapiro–Wilk normality test (when the sample size
is between 3 and 5000) and detects outliers using the 1.5*IQR rule. It is
used inside \code{\link{one_mean_test}} when \code{check_assumptions = TRUE}.
}
\examples{
set.seed(123)
x <- rnorm(30, mean = 5, sd = 2)

# Verbose output
check_assumptions(x, alpha = 0.05, verbose = TRUE)

# Silent output (used internally by one_mean_test)
a_res <- check_assumptions(x, alpha = 0.05, verbose = FALSE)
a_res
